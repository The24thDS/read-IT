# read-IT

read IT is an app that I made in order to challenge myself and because I needed a way to save articles that I wanted to read.
It has a pretty good UI, considering that I am 0% artistic and it gets the job done!

Functions:
- it acts like a todo app
- you can store items with URLs
- when you click an item that contains a link, it will open the link in your default browser
- when you check an item it gets disabled but it gives you 2 seconds time to uncheck it, after that, is gone forever

Below you can see some images
